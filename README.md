# Statistical Analysis Project

## Overview

This project contains a collection of Python scripts designed to perform various statistical analyses. The purpose of this project is to provide tools for calculating key statistical measures such as ANOVA, variance, standard deviation, interquartile range (IQR), skewness, kurtosis, Z-scores, P-values, and T-values.

## Contents

### Python Scripts
- **`Anova.py`**: Perform Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to compare the means of three or more groups.
- **`ZScore.py`**: Calculate Z-scores, which indicate how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean.
- **`Variance_and_SD.py`**: Calculate the variance and standard deviation of a dataset.
- **`P_T_values.py`**: Compute P-values and T-values, essential for hypothesis testing and determining statistical significance.
- **`Skewness_Kurtosis.py`**: Calculate skewness and kurtosis to describe the asymmetry and peakedness of a data distribution.
- **`IQR.py`**: Compute the Interquartile Range (IQR) to measure statistical dispersion.

## How to Use

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.x
   - Required Python packages: `numpy`, `scipy`

2. **Running the Scripts**:
   - Each script can be executed independently. Navigate to the directory where the script is located and run it using Python:
     ```bash
     python script_name.py
     ```
   - For example, to run the ANOVA script:
     ```bash
     python Anova.py
     ```

3. **Understanding the Output**:
   - The scripts will print the calculated statistical measures to the console. The output will vary depending on the script being executed.

## Installation

To install the required Python packages, you can use the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy scipy
```
